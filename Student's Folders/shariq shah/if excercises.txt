1. Write a program that accepts three integers and finds the maximum of three.
Test Data :
Input the first integer: 25
Input the second integer: 35
Input the third integer: 15
Expected Output:
Maximum value of three integers: 35


3.Write a program that reads 5 numbers and sums all odd values between them.
Test Data :
Input the first number: 11
Input the second number: 17
Input the third number: 13
Input the fourth number: 12
Input the fifth number: 5
Expected Output:
Sum of all odd values: 46

4. Write a program that reads two integers and checks whether they are multiplied or not.
Test Data :
Input the first number: 5
Input the second number: 15
Expected Output:
Multiplied!

5. Write a program to read the coordinates (x, y) (in the Cartesian system) and find the quadrant to which it belongs (Quadrant -I, Quadrant -II, Quadrant -III, Quadrant -IV).
Note: A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.
These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by Roman numerals: I (where the signs of the (x,y) coordinates are I(+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−).
Test Data :
Input the Coordinate(x,y):
x: 25
y: 15
Expected Output:
Quadrant-I(+,+)

8. Write a program to compute the sum of two given integers. If two values are the same, return the triple of their sum.

### 1.  Introduction to Programming: 
   -  What is Programming? : Explain what programming is and how computers follow instructions.
   -  Introduction to Python : Briefly introduce Python as a language and why itâ€™s great for beginners.

### 12.  Introduction to IDEs/Code Editors: 
   -  Using an IDE : Teach them how to use a simple IDE like Thonny or VS Code for writing and testing their code.


### 2.  Basic Syntax: 
   -  Printing to the Screen : Start with simple print statements (e.g., `print("Hello, World!")`).
   -  Comments : Teach them how to write comments to describe their code (e.g., `# This is a comment`).

### 3.  Variables and Data Types: 
   -  Variables : What they are and how to use them (e.g., `name = "Alice"`).
   -  Data Types : Cover basic types like strings, integers, and floats.
   -  Basic Operations : Simple arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction).

### 4.  Input/Output: 
   -  Taking Input : How to get user input (e.g., `input("What is your name? ")`).
   -  Basic Formatting : How to format and display outputs.

### 5.  Conditionals (If Statements): 
   -  If Statements : Introduce `if`, `else`, and `elif`.
   -  Comparison Operators : Teach `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

### 6.  Loops: 
   -  For Loops : Basic iteration over a range or list.
   -  While Loops : Explain the concept of a loop that continues until a condition is met.
   -  Loop Control : Use `break` and `continue` to control loops.

### 8.  Lists and Dictionaries: 
   -  Lists : Introduction to lists, indexing, and simple operations.
   -  Dictionaries : Basic key-value pairs and how to use them.

### 7.  Functions: 
   -  Defining Functions : How to define and call functions (e.g., `def my_function():`).
   -  Parameters and Return Values : Simple examples of functions with parameters and return values.

### 10.  Introduction to Libraries: 
   -  Simple Graphics with Turtle : Introduce the `turtle` module to make simple drawings.
   -  Random Module : Use `random` for games like dice rolls or random selections.
   -  Time/Datemtime: 
   - 

### 9.  Simple Projects: 
   -  Guess the Number Game : A fun way to integrate conditionals, loops, and functions.
   -  Basic Calculator : A project to practice arithmetic operations and input/output.
   -  Story Generator : Using strings, input, and lists to create a simple interactive story.


### 11.  Good Programming Practices: 
   -  Readability : Emphasize writing clear, readable code.
   -  Debugging : Encourage them to debug and solve errors in their code.

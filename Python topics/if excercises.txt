1. Write a program that accepts three integers and finds the maximum of three.
Test Data :
Input the first integer: 25
Input the second integer: 35
Input the third integer: 15
Expected Output:
Maximum value of three integers: 35

2.  Write a C program that reads an integer and checks the specified range to which it belongs. Print an error message if the number is negative and greater than 80.
Test Data :
Input an integer: 15
Expected Output:
Range [0, 20]

3.Write a C program that reads 5 numbers and sums all odd values between them.
Test Data :
Input the first number: 11
Input the second number: 17
Input the third number: 13
Input the fourth number: 12
Input the fifth number: 5
Expected Output:
Sum of all odd values: 46

4. Write a C program that reads two integers and checks whether they are multiplied or not.
Test Data :
Input the first number: 5
Input the second number: 15
Expected Output:
Multiplied!

5. Write a C program to read the coordinates (x, y) (in the Cartesian system) and find the quadrant to which it belongs (Quadrant -I, Quadrant -II, Quadrant -III, Quadrant -IV).
Note: A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.
These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by Roman numerals: I (where the signs of the (x,y) coordinates are I(+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−).
Test Data :
Input the Coordinate(x,y):
x: 25
y: 15
Expected Output:
Quadrant-I(+,+)

6. Write a C program to calculate the sum of all numbers not divisible by 17 between two given integer numbers.
Test Data :
Input the first integer: 50 Input the second integer: 99
Expected Output:
Sum: 3521

7. Write a C program that finds all integer numbers that divide by 7 and have a remainder of 2 or 3 between two given integers.
Test Data :
Input the first integer: 25
Input the second integer: 45
Expected Output:
30
31
37
38
44

8. Write a C# program to compute the sum of two given integers. If two values are the same, return the triple of their sum.

9. Write a C# program to check if the given integer is within 20 of 100 or 200.
Sample Output:
Input an integer:
25
False

1. Create a dictionary to store the names and ages of five people. Write a program to display the name of the oldest person.
2. Write a program to add a new key-value pair to an existing dictionary.
3. Write a program to create a nested dictionary and access its elements.
4. Write a program to find the length of the longest key in a dictionary.
5. Given a dictionary, write a program to check if a specific value exists in the dictionary.
6. Write a program to swap the values of two keys in a dictionary.
7. Write a program to check if two dictionaries are equal (i.e., have the same keys and values).
8. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

9. Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.

Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

10. Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.

11. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

12. Write a Python program to remove a key from a dictionary.

13. Write a Python program to check if a dictionary is empty or not.

14. Write a Python program to combine two dictionary by adding values for common keys.
d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}
d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}
Sample output: Counter({'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300})

15. Write a Python program to create and display all combinations of letters, selecting each letter from a different key in a dictionary.
Sample data : {'1':['a','b'], '2':['c','d']}
Expected Output:
ac
ad
bc
bd

16. Write a Python program to combine values in a list of dictionaries.
Sample data: [{'item': 'item1', 'amount': 400}, {'item': 'item2', 'amount': 300}, {'item': 'item1', 'amount': 750}]
Expected Output: Counter({'item1': 1150, 'item2': 300})

17. Write a Python program to create a dictionary from a string.
Note: Track the count of the letters from the string.
Sample string : 'w3resource'
Expected output: {'w': 1, '3': 1, 'r': 2, 'e': 2, 's': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1, 'c': 1}

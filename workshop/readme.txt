# Handout: “You’re not late—you’re early”

* Core idea: Don’t start freelancing yet. Start learning a skill.
* Why skills > gigs: Clients buy results, not potential.
* How to pick a first skill: interest × demand × visible outcomes.
* Starter skill menu (examples):

  * Web: HTML/CSS landing pages, WordPress install/theme
  * Data: Excel/Google Sheets cleaning, simple charts, basic Python
  * Design: Canva social posts, simple thumbnails, brand kit basics
  * Writing: Product descriptions, basic blog editing/proofreading
* Proof before pay: 3 tiny portfolio pieces > 30 certificates.
* Ethics & safety: use legal assets, cite sources, no AI copy-paste without review, never work without clear scope.
